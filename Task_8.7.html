	    <p>Very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes 
		unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; passing this threshold is 
		the cause of all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause 
		violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, 
		or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and 
		the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.
